Introduction

The tool is used for the paper [A Novel TOPSIS Evaluation Scheme for Cloud Service Trustworthiness Combining Objective and Subjective Aspects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016412121830092X).

We successfully test the tool in the environment of Windows 7, 32 bit, service pack 1.
Before running the antomated evaluation tool, please copy the folder named "Test cloud services" to the root directory of disk d, i.e. D:\ because we set it as the default folder in the tool. The folder contains 10 files, which are the 10 groups of Web services searched from the QWS dataset (version 1.0) and each group only includes the first nine attributes for ease of use as pointed in experiment 1.
A shortcut of the tool named "TOPSIS evaluation scheme.exe" is created, accompanying with the folder named "dist". When double click the shortcut, the interface can be displayed. Then we can operate according to the following steps:

1. Click "Import..." button and choose a file i.e. the services to be evaluated in the open file dialog;
2. Input the trust preference i.e. weights to the nine different attributes for services in the text boxes at the bottom of the interface, then click the button "Set Preference";
3. Click the button "Evaluate", then the results are shown in the list box;
4. Click the button "Save" to save the results in a text file (.txt or .csv format);
5. Click the button "Quit" to exit the tool.
